        <p>On a humid July morning in 2018, Mr. Brown and Mr. Myers entered the Pemigewasset Wilderness in New Hampshire's White Mountains. After hiking for several hours, the duo reached a trail junction and decided to rest for a moment. Brown wandered off to identify some of the stunning deciduous trees while his companion eased his aching body onto the forest floor. Myers was exhausted. The hike had sapped the energy from his rapidly aging bones, and before he knew it, he was fast asleep. When Brown eventually returned, he encountered a most disturbing sight: a large, salivating black bear was quietly approaching Myers' prone body, its intentions clear. Without thinking of his own safety, Brown jumped into action. He grabbed a nearby trekking pole and stood over Myers' prone, vulnerable body. "Stay away from my friend! You can't eat him!" Brown insisted. However, the black bear refused to relent. Suddenly, the forest went silent. Brown and the black bear locked eyes for a moment, a minute, an hour, a lifetime. Who would be the first to budge? The black bear pawed the ground and took a giant step forward. Brown did the same. As the bear stood up on its hind legs, Brown fearlessly charged it, which was enough to scare the beast away. Awakened by the harrowing experience, Myers looked up at Brown, the sun casting a shining halo around his brave head. "That was incredible," he began. "I owe you my life."</p>
