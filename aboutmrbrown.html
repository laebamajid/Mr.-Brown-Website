    <h2>About Mr Brown</h2>
    <div class="about-container">

        <p> Mr. Brown is a beloved English teacher at Westborough High School, known for his energetic personality, sense of humor, and deep passion for literature and the outdoors. In his youth he attended Marian High School in Framingham. Massachusetts. It wasn't until college where he discovered his love for academics, particularly English. Inspired by his college professors, he majored in English and pursued teaching to share his love for reading in discussion with the future generation. Outside of teaching, Mr Brown is an avid hiker, hoping to hike all 48 of New Hampshire's 4,000 foot mountains. He regularly embarks on hiking, camping, and backpacking with family, friends, and sometimes students (in his adventure lit class). One of his most unforgettable adventures was a multi-day bakcpacking trip during which he saved his friend and fellow English teacher, Mr Myers. In addition to his love for the outdoors Mr Brown enjoys woodworking and has a full workshop at home where he builds furniture such as tables and cabinets. Mr. Brown's classroom is governed by two simple rules: Don't be a jerk, and don't be lame. These rules reflect his desires for his students to be kind and engages in class.</p>
